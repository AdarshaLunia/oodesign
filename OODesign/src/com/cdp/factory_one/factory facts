Factory Method

*Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. 
 Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
*Defining a "virtual" constructor.
*The new operator considered harmful.

*The advantage of a Factory Method is that it can return the same instance multiple times, or can return 
a subclass rather than an object of that exact type.

*The new operator considered harmful. There is a difference between requesting an object and creating one. The new operator always creates an object, and fails
 to encapsulate object creation. A Factory Method enforces that encapsulation, and allows an object to be 
 requested without inextricable coupling to the act of creation.
