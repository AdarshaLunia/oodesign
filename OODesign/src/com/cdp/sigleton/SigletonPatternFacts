In general we follow below steps to create a singleton class:

1:Override the private constructor to avoid any new object creation with new operator.
2:Declare a private static instance of the same class
3:Provide a public static method that will return the singleton class instance variable. If the variable is not initialized then initialize it or else simply return the instance variable.


There are two ways to achieve Thread-Safety :
1: Synchronized getInstance()
2: Synchronized Block inside for-loop


Various Approach to create Singleton

Eager initialization
Lazy initialization
Static block initialization
