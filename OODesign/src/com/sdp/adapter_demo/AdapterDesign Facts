* Ever tried to use a your camera memory card in your laptop. You cannot use it directly simply because 
  there is no port in laptop which accept it. You must use a compatible card reader. You put your memory 
  card into card reader and then inject card reader into laptop. This card reader can be called adapter.
  
* In programming as well, adapter pattern is used for similar purposes. It enable two incompatible 
  interfaces to work smoothly with each other
